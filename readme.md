Music Store Project

I have created a basic application for keeping track of stock in a record store. Users can add new stock(albums and artists). Edit existing stock as well as delete unwanted stock. Users can also search for stock as well as change sale prices where necessary. Any stock that is created is saved into a postgres database. The project was created using SQL, Ruby, HTML and CSS

Getting Started

New users merely need to pull the code down from github and place it into their own folder of choosing

Prerequisites

1. Postgres/other sql software
2. A database called "record_store" in order to save new stock
3. A text editor if the user wishes to look at the code
4. Sinatra gems installed to run the server
5. A modern browser which can display CSS correctly

Give examples
Installing
